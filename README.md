# Basic information
This is a simple program I developed that sends notifications directly to my phone using the Pushover API. It is designed to notify me whenever I complete a task and helps track my progress. My goal is to complete one task per day, excluding weekends.

# Future ampliations
In the future, I plan to expand this program by hosting it on a server. This would allow me to schedule notifications at a specific time each day, automating the process further.
